## Project Objectives


## Project Description

Our project is a community web service that introduces new products from convenience stores and reviews onvenience stores products. There are five typical main functions.


  First, users can check information on new products released by various convenience store brands through our web service. New product information includes product name, product image, brand, price, product description, purchase link, and review link. By searching categories by convenience store brand, users can search for new product information by brand.

  Second, on the review board, users can view or write reviews of convenience store products. The review form includes brand, item, price, rating score, title, review content, and product images. Users can sort reviews in the latest or rating score order. In addition, user can search for categories by brand, item, and price range and search for titles. It also has the functions to modify or delete postings.

  Third, on the recipe board, users can read or write recipes for convenience store food. The recipe posting form includes title, materials, content, and image files. Users can search for writings through the title search function. It also has the functions to modify or delete postings.

  Fourth, users can see what convenience stores are around them through a map on the convenience store view page. It was implemented using Kakao Map api.

  Fifth, on My Page, users can view or modify their personal information. On the MyInfo tab, users can view their ID, the number of reviews and recipes, and level information and can change their passwords. Users can also see their convenience store usage, which is graphically visualized based on the number of reviews users wrote. On the Post tab, users can view their own recipes and reviews at a glance by the date of registration, and enter the linked link to modify or delete the postings immediately.
